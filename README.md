# SigEnergy Optimizer for Home Assistant OS

This guide is for Home Assistant OS users running the SigEnergy Optimizer as a Home Assistant Add-on.

## Scope and Safety

This optimizer replaces the old blueprint automations for SigEnergy control.
Do not run both at the same time.

Safe order:
1. Disable old blueprint automations.
2. Verify or create required helpers.
3. Install and configure the add-on.
4. Start the add-on.
5. Verify behavior and logs.

## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant OS
- SigEnergy entities available in Home Assistant
- Amber price entities available in Home Assistant
- Solcast entities available in Home Assistant
- Home Assistant Long-Lived Access Token

## Install the Add-on Repository

1. Open Home Assistant: Settings -> Add-ons -> Add-on Store -> Repositories
2. Add repository URL:
   - https://github.com/Belot77/sigenergy-optimizer
3. Find SigEnergy Optimizer in the Add-on Store

## Step 1 - Disable Old Blueprint Automations

Go to Settings -> Automations and Scenes and disable or remove:
- sigenergy_optimiser
- sigenergy_manual_control

## Step 2 - Verify or Create Required Helpers

If you previously used the YAML automations, these may already exist.
Check Developer Tools -> States for these exact entity IDs:

- input_boolean.sigenergy_automated_export
- input_number.sigenergy_export_session_start_kwh
- input_number.sigenergy_import_session_start_kwh
- input_number.battery_min_soc_to_last_till_sunrise
- input_text.sigenergy_last_export_notification
- input_text.sigenergy_last_import_notification
- input_text.sigenergy_reason
- input_select.sigenergy_mode

If all exist, continue to Step 3.
If any are missing, create only the missing helpers.

### Helper YAML (optional)

If you prefer YAML helper creation, add this and restart Home Assistant:

```yaml
input_boolean:
  sigenergy_automated_export:
    name: "SigEnergy Automated Export"

input_number:
  sigenergy_export_session_start_kwh:
    name: "Export Session Start (kWh)"
    min: 0
    max: 9999
    step: 0.001
    unit_of_measurement: "kWh"

  sigenergy_import_session_start_kwh:
    name: "Import Session Start (kWh)"
    min: 0
    max: 9999
    step: 0.001
    unit_of_measurement: "kWh"

  battery_min_soc_to_last_till_sunrise:
    name: "Min SoC to Last Till Sunrise"
    min: 0
    max: 100
    step: 0.1
    unit_of_measurement: "%"

input_text:
  sigenergy_last_export_notification:
    name: "Last Export Notification"
    max: 255

  sigenergy_last_import_notification:
    name: "Last Import Notification"
    max: 255

  sigenergy_reason:
    name: "Current Reason"
    max: 255

input_select:
  sigenergy_mode:
    name: "SigEnergy Mode"
    options:
      - Automated
      - Force Full Export
      - Force Full Import
      - Force Full Import + PV
      - Prevent Import & Export
      - Manual
    initial: Automated
```

## Step 3 - Configure the Add-on

Open the add-on Configuration tab and set at least:

- ha_url
- ha_token

Notes:
- The token is required. The optimizer authenticates to Home Assistant REST and WebSocket APIs using ha_token.
- Advanced overrides can be added in extra_env as KEY=value lines.

## Step 4 - Start and Open

1. Start the add-on.
2. Open Web UI from the add-on page.

You should see current state, active decision, and manual override controls.

## What The Main Buttons Mean (Plain English)

These buttons are easy to confuse at first. Here is what each one does in everyday terms.

### Simulate Automated

- Think of this as a practice run.
- It tries different strategy styles and shows which one looks best right now.
- The simulation comparison panel is hidden by default and appears after you press this button.
- It only changes what you see on the screen.
- It does not change your real inverter settings.

### Run Cycle Now

- Think of this as "do the real check now".
- It makes the optimizer run immediately instead of waiting for the next normal cycle.
- This can apply real control changes (mode/limits) if the optimizer decides they are needed.
- Use this when you want an immediate live refresh/action.

### Preview (inside Simulation cards)

- Preview means "select this option and inspect it".
- It updates the comparison view and details so you can review that strategy.
- It does not draw the full simulation overlay on the chart.
- It does not change live settings.

### Overlay This (inside Simulation cards)

- Overlay means "draw this scenario over the live chart".
- It visually places the simulated path on top of your normal chart so you can compare easier.
- It is still a visual what-if tool only.
- It does not change live settings.

Quick rule of thumb:
- Preview = pick and inspect.
- Overlay = show it on the chart.
- Simulate Automated = run a what-if comparison.
- Run Cycle Now = run the real optimizer immediately.

### Clear Simulation

- After running simulation, the Simulate Automated button changes to Clear Simulation.
- Clear Simulation removes the visual simulation overlay and hides the simulation comparison panel again.
- It does not change live inverter settings.

## Step 5 - Verify Correct Operation

- Add-on logs: Settings -> Add-ons -> SigEnergy Optimizer -> Logs
- Optional CLI: ha addons logs local_sigenergy_optimizer

Quick check:
1. Use a manual override in the UI.
2. Confirm expected EMS mode and limits are written.
3. Return to Automated mode.

## Configuration Tuning

Use the dashboard for day-to-day threshold tuning (Apply and Save).

For advanced keys, use extra_env in add-on config, for example:

```text
MAX_PRICE_THRESHOLD=0.015
TARGET_BATTERY_CHARGE=2.0
EXPORT_THRESHOLD_LOW=0.10
EXPORT_THRESHOLD_MEDIUM=0.20
EXPORT_THRESHOLD_HIGH=1.00
EXPORT_LIMIT_LOW=5.0
EXPORT_LIMIT_MEDIUM=12.0
EXPORT_LIMIT_HIGH=25.0
PV_SURPLUS_ESTIMATED_INIT_ENABLED=true
SUNRISE_RESERVE_SOC=10.0
MORNING_DUMP_MIN_SOC=30.0
```

Morning Dump uses `MORNING_DUMP_HOURS_BEFORE_SUNRISE` as a compatibility key for
the total window duration ending one hour after sunrise. For example, `0.5`
starts 30 minutes after sunrise and can run for up to 30 minutes. Morning Dump
cannot start or continue at or below `MORNING_DUMP_MIN_SOC`, which defaults to
30%, regardless of forecast refill confidence.

After changing add-on config, restart the add-on.

## Solcast provider-aware Solar charge freshness

Dynamic Solar charge-ceiling ownership uses provider refresh evidence separately
from Forecast Today's HA observation age. Map `forecast_today_sensor` and
`solcast_api_last_polled_sensor` to entities from the same Solcast instance. Their
default entity IDs are `sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_forecast_today` and
`sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_api_last_polled`; compatible environment keys are
`FORECAST_TODAY_SENSOR` and `SOLCAST_API_LAST_POLLED_SENSOR`.

Startup/reconnect/reload requires a baseline followed by a successful API Last
Polled advance. Normal charging remains available while unverified. Later
schedules and successful manual polls before a retained deadline cannot extend
that deadline. Expiry releases only the dynamic Solar charge restriction;
Solar remains subject to all existing MSC/PV-only and ownership protections.

Settings -> Forecast Safety exposes **Forecast observation maximum age (seconds)**,
using the existing `hvac_solar_forecast_max_age_seconds` /
`HVAC_SOLAR_FORECAST_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` key and 600-second default. It applies to
Remaining Today, Power Now, Forecast Today trust for Standby Holdoff, age-based
Forecast Tomorrow trust and selected import-price forecast freshness. Dynamic
Solar provider freshness is schedule/provider-aware and is not extended by it.

Before live acceptance, inspect provider state, poll/high-water/verified times,
retained/advertised deadlines, source/epoch and rejection reasons in Decision
Trace. Operator-supplied startup evidence reports `.73` at source
`46d36358d38137231dff081176a372c3aa1f4cee`; this is not direct reviewer HA
access. The Solar low-surplus continuation change below is merged in main and
prepared for candidate `.74`; it has not been released, deployed or live-verified.

### Solar low-surplus continuation (.74 candidate, 20 October 2026)

After successful final Solar application, existing MSC export permission may
bridge a brief dip strictly before 15 seconds after the older fresh, coherent
PV/load report proving measured surplus above 0.5 kW.
Only a newly advancing PV and load report pair can renew the hold. Held or
cached reports, surplus from 0.2 to 0.5 kW, and forecast evidence cannot renew
it. Trust, coherent-flow, authority or application failure invalidates proof
immediately. Expiry requests conservative closure under current control
authority; failed applications retain deadline re-evaluation with bounded
three-second retries. Physical closure still requires actuator settlement.

A sanitized deterministic characterization reproduces seven 25-to-zero kW
closures at baseline; the candidate retains permission through those short
dips with renewed strong measured reports. Its
mocked application and real-tick timing do not constitute a full trace replay
or physical inverter proof; the physical cause remains unproven. This candidate
has not been released or deployed.

Candidate `2.3.63-haos74` aligns all five release markers and retains the reviewed
control behavior from PR #26. Publication and installation remain separate from
candidate preparation. See [the .74 release and supervised proof plan](docs/HAOS74_RELEASE_CANDIDATE.md).

## Common Issues

Connection refused:
- Check ha_url in add-on config
- Ensure Home Assistant is reachable from add-on runtime

Entity not found:
- Verify entity IDs in Developer Tools -> States
- Add missing helper entities from Step 2
- Use extra_env for non-default sensor/entity IDs if needed

Blank UI or stale state:
- Wait up to 60 seconds for initial cycle/heartbeat
- Check add-on logs
- Reopen via Open Web UI

## Stop or Uninstall

Stop:
- Add-on page -> Stop

Uninstall:
1. Stop add-on
2. Uninstall add-on
3. Re-enable old blueprint automations only if you are rolling back

## Operational Notes

- Decision loop is event-driven with a 60-second heartbeat fallback.
- State inputs include battery, PV, load, and price signals.
- Hardware limit clamping uses live ESS caps, then cached last-known-good caps, then fallback.

## Version

Latest published release: [**2.3.62-haos73**](https://github.com/Belot77/sigenergy-optimizer/releases/tag/v2.3.62-haos73), published 19 October 2026. Tag/source `46d36358d38137231dff081176a372c3aa1f4cee`; verified amd64/arm64 OCI index `sha256:a2313bed130c77d7fa4139b03adf67c4282f7a59c1ed116d8d64083e9cfc6f59`. PR #24 merged the reviewed tree at `d8d78320c43096bbae30210bf8bcaa60ec3313d0`.

Supplied 20 October startup logs identify runtime `.73` and that exact source. Supervisor reports a local `.71` to `.73` build with matching `BUILD_VERSION`. This establishes supplied installed-build identity, not comprehensive physical or long-term acceptance.

`.73` includes version/source-pinned builds and resolved full-SHA recording, while carrying `.72` optimizer control behavior unchanged. The `.72` corrections cover Solar Override selected/protected floors, Morning Dump discharge intent and blocked-Dump MSC fallback, application-outcome trace recording, and precise positive sub-1-cent FiT explanations. The frozen `.72` tag/image exclude the Dockerfile source-pinning fix.

Current live-memory recording is demonstrated, including pending/error outcomes and later successful Automated/MSC applications. Persistent 24-hour download freshness and intermittent MSC settlement remain **parked, unresolved** by operator choice; HA/hardware cause is unproven. Short physical Demand Window import spikes remain separately deferred. See [current issues, past-week fixes and the .73 live-proof checklist](docs/HAOS73_STATUS_AND_LIVE_PROOF.md).

Protected rollback reference: **2.3.54-haos65**, source `9965e79133f38d5b9943dcf5a9b04ed6fdab1239`, public OCI index `sha256:dd7efe0fd9b192ae1fd996137c312e5f2aab12e01a285f6e75fb5a58dc8fe88c`. There is no GitHub Release for `.65`; an actual usable Supervisor restore/reinstall method and saved effective settings remain unverified. Artifact availability alone is not rollback proof.

Existing unfinished worktrees and the separate local archive-characterization tests remain preserved. The physical-export software default remains `0.0` (disabled); the reported site limit is not a universal default. This documentation checkpoint changes no application behavior, thresholds, settings or permanent instructions. The historical `release.sh` remains unsuitable: it preserves the haos suffix, updates only three of five markers, stages all changes and can commit/tag/push. Do not use it without a separate repair/review. Future releases, deployments and deliberately provoked live tests require their own scoped approval.

## Historical Maintainer Release Flow (not current instructions)

The helper examples below are historical. `release.sh` preserves an existing `haos` suffix and updates only three of the five established version markers. Do not use it for a future release until this behavior has a separate fix and review. For future catalog or publication work, create and verify the matching source tag before advertising the version or relying on a version-tag build; publication requires separate authorization.

Historical helper usage (do not use for current releases without separate review):

```bash
./release.sh patch
./release.sh minor "Release vX.Y.Z"
./release.sh major "Release vX.0.0"
./release.sh --dry-run patch
```

Notes:
- Historical behavior: the script updates only three of the five version markers and preserves an existing `haos` suffix.
- Historically it created and pushed `vX.Y.Z` to trigger `.github/workflows/build.yml`; do not treat these examples as current release instructions.
- If `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set, the helper polls GitHub Actions and reports success/failure.
